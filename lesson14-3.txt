NSString objects are used throughout Foundation and other Cocoa frameworks, serving as the basis for all textual and linguistic functionality on the platform.NSString is toll-free bridged with its Core Foundation counterpart, CFStringRef. See Toll-Free Bridging for more information.String ObjectsAn NSString object encodes a Unicode-compliant text string, represented as a sequence of UTF–16 code units. All lengths, character indexes, and ranges are expressed in terms of 16-bit platform-endian values, with index values starting at 0.An NSString object can be initialized from or written to a C buffer, an NSData object, or the contents of an NSURL. It can also be encoded and decoded to and from or any other string encoding represented by NSStringEncoding.NoteAn immutable string is a text string that is defined when it is created and subsequently cannot be changed. An immutable string is implemented as an array of UTF–16 code units (in other words, a text string). To create and manage an immutable string, use the NSString class. To construct and manage a string that can be changed after it has been created, use NSMutableString.";
